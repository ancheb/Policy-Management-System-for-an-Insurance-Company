    2. Policyholder Management
These methods will mostly be within the Policyholder class (policyholder.py) as described above.
Consider using a unique identifier (like policy_number) to easily access and manage policyholder data.


    3. Payment Management
The Payment class (payment.py) will handle these functionalities.
You might need to use the datetime module to handle dates and calculate the number of days overdue.
    
    
    4. Product Management
These methods will be in the Product class (product.py).
You might want to add methods to retrieve product details or list all available products.
